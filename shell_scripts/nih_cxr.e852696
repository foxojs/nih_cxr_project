If the anaconda3/personal module is the only one you're using in your jobscripts, then you should consider moving to our newer cluster - CX3 Phase 2.
It provides a number of improvements as well as new GPU's (NVIDIA L40S's). It runs off of the RDS, meaning all your work will remain as is.
All you need to do is log in to the new cluster:
