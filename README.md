This repository implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch, designed for medical image classification using the NIH Chest X-ray 14 (CXR14) dataset. It includes everything from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, providing a complete pipeline for experimenting with ViTs in medical imaging.
